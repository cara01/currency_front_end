# currency_front_end
Currency Front End App - Angular 11.

# How to run the app

simply type `ng serve`

# to do:

1. Handle API errors - I ran out of time to do this
2. Refactor the currencies component into two components - one for the saving of data, and the other for displaying it (again, I ran out of time)
3. Make the back end in Laravel - it's actually simple to do, but springboot was simpler to do!

# demo - will be available soon on a URL to be advised.
